# Press Kit

All assets are living in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3ps5V85ERU1BhYBO37cYCO/Yearn-v2-brand?node-id=10%3A13). This includes:

- Logos
- Colors

## Assets

SVG assets don't lose quality when scaled, but they might not be compatible with some platforms.

PNG assets lose quality when scaled but they have wide compatibility across all platforms.

## Colors

We have 3 colors in total: 1 primary color and 2 secondary colors.

We mostly use the primary one for accents and the secondary ones for gradients.

- Primary Blue: `#0657F9`

- Secondary Blue:
  - Dark blue: `#095EB5`
  - Light blue: `#0077FC`

## Fonts

We have 2 fonts, one primary, and one secondary.

We use the primary font for almost everything, like titles, paragraphs, and logos.

And we use the secondary font for numerals/metrics and any text block that requires same-width lines.

Primary font: [Roboto](https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto), [example](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=yearn.finance%20is%20a%20blue%20chip&preview.text_type=custom)

Secondary font: [Roboto Mono](https://github.com/googlefonts/RobotoMono), [example](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?preview.text=yearn.finance%20is%20a%20blue%20chip&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto+mono)
